# technical-writing-portfoilo

 This portfolio will contain my technical writing samples.

 This is my first time using Git, Github, and text editors. There will be mistakes but as time goes on I hope to create a solid portfolio site to show case my works.

 I am currently a help desk technician, branching out, and seeing if I can find a foot hold in technical writing.
